## Experiment 2 - Numpy
### NORMALIZATION PROBLEM
Normalization is one of the most basic preprocessing techniques in data analytics. This involves centering and scaling process. Centering means subtracting the data from the mean and scaling means dividing with its standard deviation.</br></br>
In Python, element-wise mean and element-wise standard deviation can be obtained by using .mean() and
.std() calls. </br></br>
In this problem, create a random 5 x 5 ndarray and store it to variable X. Normalize X. Save your normalized ndarray as X_normalized.npy </br> </br>

### DIVISIBLE BY 3 PROBLEM
Create the following 10 x 10 ndarray. </br></br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a45c0acb-d023-44b8-a2e6-e9e4e1ecac3f) </br></br>
Which are the squares of the first 100 positive integers.</br>
From this ndarray, determine all the elements that are divisible by 3. Save the result as div_by_3.npy </br>
